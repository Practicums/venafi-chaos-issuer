Testing tool for cert-manager in Kubernetes.

## Description
The vision for this project is to be the standard open-source testing tool for cert-manager deployments adopted by the Kubernetes community.

Please go to [Chaos Issuer Wiki](https://github.com/kxk-4498/Venafi-test-wizard/wiki) for further information.


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

You will need the following command line tools installed on your PATH:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Golang v1.17+](https://golang.org/)
* [Docker v17.03+](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Kind v0.9.0+](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
* [Kubectl v1.11.3+](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [Kubebuilder v2.3.1+](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation)
* [Kustomize v3.8.1+](https://kustomize.io/)
* [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)

You may also want to read: the [Kubebuilder Book](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) and the [cert-manager Concepts Documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/) for further background
information.

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/venafi-test-wizard:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/venafi-test-wizard:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

# Running cert-manager locally with very less certificate duration modification #
**Note:** We hold no intellectual property of cert-manager resources and are merely using a modified local version for manual testing of our testing wizard.
**Resources:** [Building cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/building/ ), [Developing with Kind](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/kind/)

1. create a folder outside this github directory

```sh
mkdir cert-manager-local
cd cert-manager-local
```

2. git clone cert-manager

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager.git
```

3. Make sure you have all dependencies installed which are git, curl, GNU make, jq, docker and go.

4. go inside cert-manager git repository you cloned.
```sh
cd cert-manager
```

5. For modifying the certificate duration and renew before time:
- go inside cert-manager/internal/apis/certmanager/validation/certificate.go
- import "time" module in certificate.go
- replace the ValidateDuration function to the one given below.
- the function below changes the minimum cert duration of cert-manager to 4 minutes and mininum certificate renewal time to 2 minutes.

```sh
func ValidateDuration(crt *internalcmapi.CertificateSpec, fldPath *field.Path) field.ErrorList {
    el := field.ErrorList{}
    duration := util.DefaultCertDuration(crt.Duration)
    MinimumCertificateDuration := time.Minute * 4
    MinimumRenewBefore := time.Minute * 2
    if duration < MinimumCertificateDuration { //was cmapi.MinimumCertificateDuration
        el = append(el, field.Invalid(fldPath.Child("duration"), duration, fmt.Sprintf("certificate duration must be greater than %s", MinimumCertificateDuration))) // was  cmapi.MinimumCertificateDuration
    }
    // If spec.renewBefore is set, check that it is not less than the minimum.
    if crt.RenewBefore != nil && crt.RenewBefore.Duration < MinimumRenewBefore { //was cmapi.MinimumRenewBefore
        el = append(el, field.Invalid(fldPath.Child("renewBefore"), crt.RenewBefore.Duration, fmt.Sprintf("certificate renewBefore must be greater than %s", MinimumRenewBefore))) // was cmapi.MinimumRenewBefore
    }
    // If spec.renewBefore is set, it must be less than the duration.
    if crt.RenewBefore != nil && crt.RenewBefore.Duration >= duration {
        el = append(el, field.Invalid(fldPath.Child("renewBefore"), crt.RenewBefore.Duration, fmt.Sprintf("certificate duration %s must be greater than renewBefore %s", duration, crt.RenewBefore.Duration)))
    }
    return el
}
```

6. Run cert-manager using this command (our Chaos Issuer runs on K8S_VERSION=1.25). This command will deploy a kind cluster nameed kind and deploy cert-manager resources in it:

 ```sh
 make K8S_VERSION=1.25 e2e-setup-kind e2e-setup-certmanager
 ```
**Note:** Running cert-manager locally takes 3-5 minutes to successfully deploy.

7. Deploy cert-manager CRDs
```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.10.0/cert-manager.crds.yaml
```

# Test It Out using Script #
**NOTE:** Make sure you enable kubectl to port forward for ports 80 & 443 by (For more info: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53775328/kubernetes-port-forwarding-error-listen-tcp4-127-0-0-188-bind-permission-de)):
```
sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /usr/bin/kubectl (or /usr/local/bin/kubectl. Depends on where it is installed)
```
Incase of line ending problems if using on Mac or WSL2:
```
sed -i -e 's/\r$//' chaos_script.sh
```
0. Run the script

```sh
.\chaos_script.sh
```

1. Create the environment with the dependencies for chaos-testing:

```sh
chaos setup
```

2. Deploy the chaos issuer:

```sh
chaos deploy issuer
```

3. Deploy the certificate:

```sh
chaos deploy cert
```

4. To see available certificates:

```sh
chaos show cert
```

5. To delete the resources allocated:

```sh
chaos terminate
```


# Test It Out Manually #
0. Open a Terminal, and make sure your CRDs are compiled properly before installing them:

```sh
make generate manifests
go mod tidy
```

1. Create a Cluster using Kind (our cluster name is sample-test):

```sh
kind create cluster --name sample-test
```

2. Install Cert-Manager into the cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.10.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

3. Open a new Terminal, Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make deploy
```

4. In this new Terminal, Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to the old terminal where you created the cluster if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

5. In your older Terminal, create a namespace for our issuer and certificate (the name of our namespace is chaos here):

```sh
kubectl create namespace chaos
```

6. Install Chaos Issuer using the yaml file provided in the /config/samples:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/self-signed-issuer_v1alpha1_chaosissuer.yaml
```

7. Deploy a certificate to be signed by our self-signed Chaos Issuer using the yaml file provided in the /config/samples:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/certificate_chaosissuer.yaml
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

## Modifying the API definitions ##
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)
