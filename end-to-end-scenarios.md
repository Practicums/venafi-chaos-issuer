# Sequence Diagram for end to end scenarios #
## What has been done so far: ##

The team developed a configurable Chaos Issuer where chaotic scenarios and their parameters can be given inside the yaml file of the issuer or given as an command in the chaos issuer CLI. The Chaos Issuer will then sign the certificate based on the chaotic scenario it is deployed with.

## Question: ##
Jing - "I see a clear separation from the target which is the system/cluster thatâ€™s been tested and the chaos test tool which is the software a QA or a Reliability engineer uses to test the robustness and resilience of the target. 

What do you think you are building? the target or the tool or both or neither? Who will be using your software? a developer, a reliability engineer or some others?".

## Our solution and approach to the question: ##

The team saw that the end-to-end component was incomplete and we are proposing the below solution to resolve this.

End Scenario script - End Scenario script contains commands for every chaotic scenario to reach its end state. It gets triggered by Chaos Issuer getting deployed with chaotic scenario flags. Only After some conditions are met such as waiting for the Chaos Issuer to sign a certificate, the script launches the set of commands to cause chaos and reach an end state and simultaneously pull logs and make a report of the whole scenario which can be shown to developer later on.

## An example of end-to-end scenarios: ##
1. Launch the base scenario working with our Chaos Issuer with all the chaotic scenario flags turned off and issue a certificate which can be used by the application. Say for example, a certificate with duration of 1 hour and a renewal time of 30 mins.
2. Now, the developer wants to launch a chaos scenario and deploys an issuer with the chaotic scenario flag set. For example, the issuer sleeps for X amount of time. **NOTE:** The end scenario script will get triggered and will be get ready to cause the end scenario to take place for issuer sleeping.
3. Now when the certificate attempts to renew, it hits the Chaos Issuer with the specfic chaos scenario flag set. If the chaos scenario selected was, say an issuer that delays the certificate signing process by 1 hour, the renewal attempt is made with 30 minutes left to expiry. If the Chaos Issuer sleeps for 1 hour, this would essentially mean the certificate signing process will not get finished before the certificate expires. **NOTE:** In order to speed up this part, the end scenario script will force renewal of the certificate.
4. This causes the application to no longer work in a secure manner as the certificate is now expired.
5. The end scenario script perodically parses the various logs and creates a final report depicting the various scenarios that happened and the chain of events which led to failure.
6. This report can be viewed by the developer to understand the whole scenario and the end result.
